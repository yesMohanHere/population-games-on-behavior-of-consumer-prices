# Population Games on Behavior of Consumer Prices

This repository simulates a population game between electricity consumers and an aggregator. The model now includes

- Prospect-theory based consumers with replicator dynamics.
- Seasonal renewable generation with stochastic noise.
- Aggregator optimization that accounts for grid constraints and risk aversion.

Run `code.py` to execute the simulation and display plots of the evolving actions, price distributions and profit.
